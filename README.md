# Protovoice Annotations

A dataset of pieces and excerpts annotated with protovoice analyses
using the [protovoice annotation tool](https://github.com/DCMLab/protovoice-annotation-tool).
Work in progress.

The directory `theory-article` contains the files used in Chapter 7 ("Protovoice Theory")
of my dissertation.
To explore them, load the corresponding `.analysis.json` file into
the [protovoice viewer](https://dcmlab.github.io/protovoice-annotation-tool/viewer/)
or the [annotation tool](https://dcmlab.github.io/protovoice-annotation-tool/).
