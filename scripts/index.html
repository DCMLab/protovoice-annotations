      <p>
        On this page, you can find a collection of protovoice analyses.
        You can explore them by clicking on individual nodes in the graph
        and seeing how they are connected to the rest of the score,
        or by walking through a derivation step by step.
        The analysis files can be found
        <a href="https://github.com/DCMLab/protovoice-annotations">on GitHub</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you want to create your own analyses,
        check out the
        <a href="https://dcmlab.github.io/protovoice-annotation-tool/">annotation tool</a>.
        To view analyses that are not in this repository,
        you can use the
        <a href="https://dcmlab.github.io/protovoice-annotation-tool/viewer/">
          protovoice viewer</a>.
        The source code for both tools is available
        <a href="https://github.com/DCMLab/protovoice-annotation-tool">on GitHub</a> as well.
